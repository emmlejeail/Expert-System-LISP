# Expert-System-LISP
Final project for Artificial Intelligence course

This Expert System was build for a course about Artificial Intelligence during my 3rd year at the UTC.

Created by Martin HEBANT, Victoria BOURGEAIS and Emmanuelle LEJEAIL

The main idea behind this system was to provide the students of our University, whith a tool. This tool, based on their tastes, should help them find an association in which they could get involved.
